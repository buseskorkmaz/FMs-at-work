All new engineers get company provided downtown parking, flexible work hours, 100% of their health insurance premiums paid for by the company, the ability to build their own work computer, and access to our kitchen with plenty of drinks and snacks. We’re looking for individuals only so please NO RECRUITERS OR AGENCIES (seriously, your emails will just go into the trash folder). In addition we’re looking for full-time employees who are already in Austin, TX or willing to relocate.\\n---\\nFounded in 2010, Main Street Hub is the CRM for Local.

As a member of our team you will be given a lot of autonomy to choose projects that interest you the most and the ability to make product decisions with our CTO Ben Lund and CEO Richard Price.\\nWe are currently tackling five incredibly difficult product challenges.  Some of these projects have been attempted by larger companies and have failed.  In order to be successful we will need to think way outside-of-the-box and take a leap into the unknown…\\nPeer Review\\nWe want to build a peer review platform that allows layers of discussion on top of a single document.  One of the biggest challenges we face is that contextual commenting at a large scale has yet to be achieved.  In order to be successful we need to find original and novel solutions because simple approaches like putting a blog-style comment box at the end of the paper has been tried before and has not been effective.\\nTo build Peer Review we must figure out a way to transform all the wide array of styles from any given PDF paper to a clean and consistent format that is embedded for a suitable commenting UI.  We are experimenting to build a rich inline-commenting and discussion interface as well as a reputation system that surfaces quality comments.\\nInterface Design\\nWe currently have 7.5 million users who upload their research papers.  Academia converts these PDFs to HTLM5 to display in the browser.  We face the challenges of building web UIs for scientific content such as 3D molecular visualizations and tools for exploring genetic sequences.  We will also build back-end parsers, converters, and storage schemes to enable these UIs.\\nRecommendation Engine\\nWe have a news feed that displays recommended papers to our users.  Currently we use a simple rule-based system where papers are tagged by research interests and our users can follow those research interests.  In addition, our users can follow each other.  We want our users to feel as if they are attending an amazing conference where everything we show them is the most relevant and up-to-date information that is available in their field.\\nIn order to improve our recommendation engine, we will be immersed in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.  We want to identify which particular field of the paper it correlates to (math, biochemistry, anthropology, etc.) and the type of document (original research, a review article, a conference presentation, a lecture note or some other content).  Using everything from a paper’s previous viewers on Academia.edu to its author and content to its place in the citation graph, we want to determine the relevance of a particular document to a particular user.  Lastly, using large-scale data analysis we want to identify trending papers, highlight influential researchers and help the public uncover important new work more quickly and reliably.\\nMobile App\\nAcademia does not have a mobile app but we are dedicated to building one!\\nWorking with a clean slate, we will design and build a mobile API that displays Academia’s core features.  These features will include the user profile, upload papers, news feed, analytic data, and the ability to make comments on papers (Peer Review).  In order to build a dynamic mobile API, we will write easy-to-use client libraries in a wide range of scripting languages that will encourage integration with Academia’s data, content and identity into their apps.\\nSpeed, Scale, &amp; Storage\\nOur engineering team will have to build highly scalable systems that effectively store and analyze our entire stream of hits.  We have built an analytics dashboard so that every user can see how many people viewed their profile and how many people have read their uploaded papers.  We enabled this feature by storing structured data in DynamoDB- currently 343 million rows and growing 10% per month.  We want to build features that require more sophisticated aggregations on this data than DynamoDB can provide.\\nFurthermore we will need to figure out how to effectively store massive amounts of data while increasing the speed of our product especially to parts of the world where there is slower internet connections.  This is important because areas in the world with slower connections tend to be where researchers can benefit the most from open access to research.  Our platform must be useable for them too.\\nFuture at Academia.edu\\nWe have a fun and agile team and we are growing (our site usage grows 10% per month)!  We have the resources to make our mission come true.  We just raised $11 million from Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. We're based in Downtown San Francisco.\\nChat with Ashley\\nIf you think you would be interested in solving some of these technical problems then please do not hesitate to contact ashley[at]academia.edu.\",\n",

       " \"Tempest Systems - Senior Full Stack Developer. Remote position (ideally within Canada).\\n--- The Job ---------------------------------\\nWe are looking for an experienced, effective senior developer who can take on a leadership role on our team. We have two established products -  and  - but we also have a list of desired features a mile long, so we need your help to continue to delight our users, and hopefully pick up a few more along the way!\\nYour first major task will be to help us transition SearchTempest from a classic server-side application to a client-side MVC framework.  We expect to achieve a fairly dramatic improvement in perceived speed of the site by removing unnecessary processing on page load, and increasing parallelization.  However, this is only one task among many.  We are looking for a highly skilled and motivated developer who can help us continue to improve all aspects of our sites.\\n--- Skills &amp; Requirements--------------------\\nYou will need advanced knowledge of modern javascript frameworks - preferably Angular, but we would consider Ember or Backbone/Marionette if you make a strong case. Also PHP (we use the Symfony2 and Slim frameworks), and SQL. (“Advanced” means you should be comfortable personally leading architecture and development using these tools.)\\nEven more importantly, you must be comfortable (and ideally experienced) working on a remote team.  Working from your preferred environment, at your preferred times, can be great for productivity (and enjoyment!) - but only if you have exceptional self-motivation. You should also be effective at communicating via chat, email, and video-conferencing (Google Hangouts), and using a project tracking tool (we use Pivotal).\\nAs a senior developer, you will be designing program architecture, writing specs for yourself and other developers to follow, and reviewing code, as well as hands-on coding.\\nHigh Priority Skills:\\n    - Client-side MVC with AngularJS (or a comparable framework)\\n    - Back-end development using PHP and a modern framework (ideally Symfony2)\\n    - Database design and maintenance (MySQL/MariaDB). Familiar with concepts like \\n      normalization, index selection, query optimization, caching, etc.\\n    - Testable program design and unit testing\\n\\nNice to Have:\\n    - Coffeescript, Twig, Handlebars, Compass/sass, Composer, Grunt\\n    - Responsive design and development\\n    - Experience testing with PHPUnit and Behat/Mink\\n    - Experience working with APIs such as YQL, Google Maps, eBay, AWS, etc.\\n\\nBonus:\\n    - Visual web design and/or graphics design\\n    - App development for iOS and/or Android\\n    - System Administration; shell scripting, familiarity with provisioning tools\\n      such as Puppet and Chef\\n\\n--- About Us -------------------------------\\nWe are a small web company based in Victoria, BC, Canada. Basically, we build handy little tools to make people's lives a little bit easier. Our current sites are  >, and  >. SearchTempest is a search engine for classifieds (which is actually more useful than it sounds!) Search multiple craigslist cities by distance from your location, plus eBay, Amazon, etc., without having to type in the same stuff over and over.\\nAutoTempest is a similar idea for used car shoppers; it lets you search all the top cars sites at once, with the results in one big list (optionally sorted by price, distance, etc.) If you're serious about finding a good deal on a car, you're searching all these sites anyway, so we save you most of the effort.\\nWe believe in a flexible, results-driven work environment. We all work from home, using the tools we choose, at the times we feel most productive. We keep in sync with Pivotal Tracker, XMPP chat, BitBucket, email, and occasional Google Hangouts meetings.\\nEveryone on our team has a significant role to play. Remote work and flexible hours mean we can each work when and where we prefer, but they also mean we have to be highly self-motivated and communicate effectively to be productive. It also helps when you really love what you do. We're looking for others who share those attributes!\",\n",

       " \"-= MATASANO SECURITY =- Chicago. New York City. Sunnyvale. Hiring Application Security Consultants\\nFull-Time or Internship, work visa sponsorship available.\\nFebruary - The shortest month of the year, and one of the coldest (maybe not so much in our Sunnyvale, CA location).  That month every year when we set aside some time to show appreciation for our loved ones through gifts, greeting cards, dinner dates, flowers, and a well considered application security posture.\\nMaybe that last one isn't on everyone's minds, but it is here at Matasano Security.  In many environments, while application security is desirable, it generally isn't a primary requirement.  Applications need to perform their core purpose, whatever that may be, so they can aid business by driving revenue.  The conflicting priorities can lead developers to make poor design decisions, rush implementations, and spend less time considering attack scenarios than would be ideal.  This isn't their fault!  It's a function of conflicting priorities and focusing on those which are most tangible, and most measure.\\nAt Matasano this balance is different.  Application security is our passion, and our goal is to fill the unmet needs our clients have to strengthen their posture.  Our singular focus on security helps us maintain an aptitude and laser guided precision that's far above the mean.  We truly enjoy combing through code, reviewing the flow of information into and out of an application, and finding places where malicious actors can leverage vulnerabilities to their advantage.  We love our clients, but it's not the sort of love you'll read about on little candy hearts.  We tell them the truth about their security, not just rosy platitudes.\\nSometimes this can mean delivering bad news when we're able to totally compromise an application and execute our own code on its server.  Other times it means explaining that when the server asks the client to identify itself, the client can just lie.  Often it means explaining that their homegrown encryption scheme is no more unintelligible than Pig Latin.  But with this bad news comes some assistance and guidance to help them prioritize improvements and strengthen their products.\\nThis sort of work requires a very particular set of skills.  A strong Application Security Consultant needs to deeply understand programming and application design.  They require a foundation in the common application vulnerabilities, exploitation techniques, and mitigations.  But more than this they need to be creative and able to maintain multiple perspectives simultaneously to find places where those perspectives are in conflict.  They need to quickly learn and teach themselves, their peers, and their clients.  Above all, they need to be able to communicate well and provide actionable advice to our clients.\\nIf you want to see more about the sorts of things we do and love, here's some resources;\\n Our blog -  >\\n The Matasano Crypto Challenges -  >\\n Microcorruption, Embedded Security CTF -  >\\nIf you think you have what we need, or just want to learn more about us, visit  > or contact us via .\",\n",

How am I supposed to understand a theorem if I don't know where it came from, why it works, or even what it really means?

We also want to pick up as much metadata as possible, such as a description of the dataset.\\n* Designing a UI that allows users to find what they're looking for, and then making that UI fast (we're currently up to about 10,000,000 datasets and 200,000,000 data points)\\nOur technology stack:\\n* Postgres + PostGIS to store the data we've imported\\n* Elasticsearch for... search\\n* Python code to import data from the original source to our database (with a tiny bit of Redis for some basic queueing)\\n* A thin PHP web application to display the data (probably soon to be replaced by node.js)\\nThings we like:\\n* Test-driven development and good test coverage (when it makes sense -- sometimes, it's better to manually test a very thin UI than to keep worrying about brittle UI tests)\\n* Releasing early and often. We deploy features as they're ready, and try to break work down to small pieces.\\n* Doing the simplest thing that could possibly work.

       " \"Classrooms look the same today as they did in the 1960s.  Help us change that at Clever (YC S12)\\nThere’s a lot of great educational software out there - think Oregon Trail, Math Blasters, and Carmen Sandiego - but teachers can’t use it in schools.  Teachers would love to use programs like these, but synchronizing data between their school’s database and external software applications is a huge problem that results in wasted time at the start of class and frustrated, bored students… which leads to software being abandoned entirely.  80% of K-12 teachers would use more software in classes if getting students logged in weren’t such a hassle, and a quarter of all class time that’s supposed to be dedicated to software is wasted on logins alone.\\nDevelopers have a similar problem: they love clean APIs, but in the education industry, they haven’t had one.  Most K-12 schools house their student data in ancient legacy databases that make integrations a nightmare.  If you’re a five-person startup and you’ve built an app that revolutionizes the way third-graders learn fractions, there’s simply no way to get your product in front of students.\\nClever (YC S12 - clever.com) is solving these problems by building a modern, developer-friendly API for schools… which we give them for free.  Developers love being able to plug into schools without having to write a complex integration for every single district they’re working with, so they pay us for access to the platform.  This business model has helped us grow quickly; we’re now in 1 in 5 schools in America (over 30,000 schools), and our product is used by millions of students every day.\\nOur goal is to become the education identity company.  The first step in that direction is our Instant Login single sign-on platform: a universal login that allows students to access all of their learning applications in one place.  (This is a big deal if you’ve ever seen a second-grader try to manage fifteen different usernames and passwords.)\\nRight now we’re a team of 40 people (17 engineers) based in downtown San Francisco.  We’re looking for full-stack engineers who can hack in Node, Go, and Python (or are willing to learn), but more importantly, we’re looking for people who share our passion for improving education.  If you’re interested, we’d love to hear from you.\\nOther stuff we like:\\n-Tech talks.  Every other Tuesday, we do “Clever Talks” during lunch where one of us will give a presentation on anything he/she’s interested in.  Recent talks have covered exoplanets, neuroscience, hacking big-company customer service interactions, and what’s wrong with American high school history education.\\n-Bughouse chess.  We play pretty frequently, although not always with Magnus Carlsen:  >\\n-Picking up new skills.  We offer unlimited Amazon credits for learning.\\nCheck us out: https://clever.com/about/jobs >\\nAt Clever, we want to work with the best people - applicants of all backgrounds and beliefs are welcome to come improve education with us.

Ultimately, I will bring in a project, lay it in front of you, and ask the team to do a planning poker session. Your velocity is set at a scant 10 points, and the timeline is bid against that initial velocity. Under promise, over deliver.\\n4. If you estimate poorly, you are expected to fix it. If the project just went off the rails due to things out of your control, then your feet won't be held to the fire, but if it's genuinely your fault, fix it. It's completely in your control.\\n5. Try the impossible. We built The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore, an impossible feat for it's day. We've built complex interfaces for Cisco, Symantec, and now are working with O'Reilly. Don't be afraid to use 2D Game frameworks if you have to. People don't contract Twin Engine Labs to do the status quo.\\n6. Be a full stack engineer. Know iOS but not Rails? Talk to us. Know Rails but not iOS? Talk to us. You will be placed in projects of your capacity, but very quickly ramped up to both  platforms. We expect you to know everything from server deployments to iOS deployments, to Postgres optimization to Core Data optimization, from caching in Restful APIs to caching NSURL connections. Being a full stack engineer allows you to move faster than every other shop out there.\\n7. Finally, work directly with the customer. You, as the engineer, will always be expected to speak with the customer faster than I can. I will always give you air cover when you need it (and I typically can see that coming from a mile away). As well, you'll hear their requirements from their mouths (no games of telephone here), and get to ask them questions, with the safety net that I always stand behind our employees.\\nPerks? Multiple projects in a year, constantly learning the cutting edge techniques, and some seriously huge names under your belt.\\nOur environment is flat. No Pointy Haired Bosses allowed or bean counters here. Paint yourself purple, turn yourself upside down, and spin around three times while you code. As long as you deliver, I don't care how you do it.\\nEmployees come into work at what is a reasonable hour to them. Our employees set their own start times, with flexible work at home situations when required. Most of them come into work because... well... we like each other :)\\nIntrigued? Talk to us. We've helped multiple entrepreneurs sink funding, watched multiple apps receive awards, and are known in our region and nationally.\",\n",

As a member of our team you will be given a lot of autonomy to choose projects that interest you the most and the ability to make product decisions with our CTO Ben Lund and CEO Richard Price.\\nWe are currently tackling five incredibly difficult product challenges.  Some of these projects have been attempted by larger companies and have failed.  In order to be successful we will need to think way outside-of-the-box and take a leap into the unknown…\\nPeer Review\\nWe want to build a peer review platform that allows layers of discussion on top of a single document.  One of the biggest challenges we face is that contextual commenting at a large scale has yet to be achieved.  In order to be successful we need to find original and novel solutions because simple approaches like putting a blog-style comment box at the end of the paper has been tried before and has not been effective.\\nTo build Peer Review we must figure out a way to transform all the wide array of styles from any given PDF paper to a clean and consistent format that is embedded for a suitable commenting UI.  We are experimenting to build a rich inline-commenting and discussion interface as well as a reputation system that surfaces quality comments.\\nInterface Design\\nWe currently have 7.5 million users who upload their research papers.  Academia converts these PDFs to HTLM5 to display in the browser.  We face the challenges of building web UIs for scientific content such as 3D molecular visualizations and tools for exploring genetic sequences.  We will also build back-end parsers, converters, and storage schemes to enable these UIs.\\nRecommendation Engine\\nWe have a news feed that displays recommended papers to our users.  Currently we use a simple rule-based system where papers are tagged by research interests and our users can follow those research interests.  In addition, our users can follow each other.  We want our users to feel as if they are attending an amazing conference where everything we show them is the most relevant and up-to-date information that is available in their field.\\nIn order to improve our recommendation engine, we will be immersed in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.  We want to identify which particular field of the paper it correlates to (math, biochemistry, anthropology, etc.) and the type of document (original research, a review article, a conference presentation, a lecture note or some other content).  Using everything from a paper’s previous viewers on Academia.edu to its author and content to its place in the citation graph, we want to determine the relevance of a particular document to a particular user.  Lastly, using large-scale data analysis we want to identify trending papers, highlight influential researchers and help the public uncover important new work more quickly and reliably.\\nMobile App\\nAcademia does not have a mobile app but we are dedicated to building one!\\nWorking with a clean slate, we will design and build a mobile API that displays Academia’s core features.  These features will include the user profile, upload papers, news feed, analytic data, and the ability to make comments on papers (Peer Review).  In order to build a dynamic mobile API, we will write easy-to-use client libraries in a wide range of scripting languages that will encourage integration with Academia’s data, content and identity into their apps.\\nSpeed, Scale, &amp; Storage\\nOur engineering team will have to build highly scalable systems that effectively store and analyze our entire stream of hits.  We have built an analytics dashboard so that every user can see how many people viewed their profile and how many people have read their uploaded papers.  We enabled this feature by storing structured data in DynamoDB- currently 343 million rows and growing 10% per month.  We want to build features that require more sophisticated aggregations on this data than DynamoDB can provide.\\nFurthermore we will need to figure out how to effectively store massive amounts of data while increasing the speed of our product especially to parts of the world where there is slower internet connections.  This is important because areas in the world with slower connections tend to be where researchers can benefit the most from open access to research.  Our platform must be useable for them too.\\nFuture at Academia.edu\\nWe have a fun and agile team and we are growing (our site usage grows 10% per month)!  We have the resources to make our mission come true.  We just raised $11 million from Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. We're based in Downtown San Francisco.\\nChat with Ashley\\nIf you think you would be interested in solving some of these technical problems then please do not hesitate to contact ashley[at]academia.edu.\",\n",
