The faster science moves, the faster the world moves. It's widely held that science is too slow, and too closed. We are working on changing that, and re-inventing the way that scientists communicate.

Instruction: Original job description for reference: 'Software developer, Stat.io - Cambridge UK, or REMOTE We aim to allow users to understand the socio-economics of any location, from the population of a country to the crime rate of a postcode. Organisations can then use this data to improve their decision-making, whether it's businesses making strategic sales and marketing decisions, NGOs trying to understand a country, or somebody else entirely. The two main technical challenges we face are: * Importing data from many different sources, from APIs to Excel files, and understanding their structure. For instance, given an Excel file, we need to determine the structure of any tables, such as which columns represent a location. We also want to pick up as much metadata as possible, such as a description of the dataset. * Designing a UI that allows users to find what they're looking for, and then making that UI fast (we're currently up to about 10,000,000 datasets and 200,000,000 data points) Our technology stack: * Postgres + PostGIS to store the data we've imported * Elasticsearch for... search * Python code to import data from the original source to our database (with a tiny bit of Redis for some basic queueing) * A thin PHP web application to display the data (probably soon to be replaced by node.js) Things we like: * Test-driven development and good test coverage (when it makes sense -- sometimes, it's better to manually test a very thin UI than to keep worrying about brittle UI tests) * Releasing early and often. We deploy features as they're ready, and try to break work down to small pieces. * Doing the simplest thing that could possibly work. Rather than planning for every possibility up front, we implement something small but useful to start with, and then iterate and refactor as necessary. What we're looking for: We were founded in Cambridge last year, and we're now working towards a product covering public data for the UK. We're looking for a software developer to join us, initially part-time for £1,000 a month + stock option plan.

We're rapidly adding new features, and we're quickly outpacing our design capabilities. In short, it’s time to hire a UX/UI designer. Our clients use our product for hours at a time. This is their tool for getting their jobs done. It is their workflow. We want it to beautiful and intuitive. It should be easy for a new client to learn, while at the same time, it should make power users feel like they’re flying through their day.

You now own the design and you will be responsible for improving it. Changes could be simple, like, ‘make this button blue’ or it could be more elaborate like, ‘add tooltips and a new customer tutorial,’ or maybe you might want to redesign aspects of the site from scratch. Ideally, within a couple weeks, clients should be telling us that they’ve noticed small, nice design improvements.

Everyday, our clients call and email to say that we're making them happy. And that feels great. But there's one problem: parts of our product are a little bit ugly and a little bit confusing. We're rapidly adding new features, and we're quickly outpacing our design capabilities. In short, it’s time to hire a UX/UI designer. Our clients use our product for hours at a time. This is their tool for getting their jobs done. It is their workflow. We want it to beautiful and intuitive. It should be easy for a new client to learn, while at the same time, it should make power users feel like they’re flying through their day. You must have experience with The Struggle of Application Design. And frankly, you should enjoy this struggle, because it’s hard to get things right, but really rewarding when you do. What would your first day on the job be like? Well, we’ve got a product live right now that processes several hundred orders per day. You now own the design and you will be responsible for improving it. Changes could be simple, like, ‘make this button blue’ or it could be more elaborate like, ‘add tooltips and a new customer tutorial,’ or maybe you might want to redesign aspects of the site from scratch. Ideally, within a couple weeks, clients should be telling us that they’ve noticed small, nice design improvements. List of Responsibilities: - Design - Usability and Utility are more important (at the moment) than purely visual appeal. As a team, we frequently meet with our clients to learn how they’re using the product. A good candidate for this role will be able to speak to users and feel out their feelings. List of Skills: - UI/UX design experience - Responsive design experience (a lot of our clients access our site on their phones) - HTML/CSS is great. At the moment, we’re using a lot of Bootstrap. Pixel perfect designs are not (yet) crucial; usability is paramount. We’re in San Francisco on a trolley-filled street in Union Square. We’re small (3 in-office employees) and we’re still building a culture. If you have ideas for how to build a blissed-out company, we’re all ears.
